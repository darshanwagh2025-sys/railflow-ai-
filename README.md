**An AI-Powered Real-Time Crowd Monitoring and Overcrowding Alert System Using YOLOv8 and Heatmap-Based Zone Analysis**

---

## 📌 Project Summary
CrowdGuard AI is an AI-powered real-time crowd monitoring and alert system designed to enhance safety, surveillance, and crowd management using computer vision.

✅ Key highlights:
- ⚡ Real-time Crowd Detection: Leverages YOLOv8 Nano for fast, efficient people detection on live video streams or uploaded videos.
- 🗺️ Zone-Based Density Analysis: Splits video frames into a 3×3 grid to monitor people density within each zone.
- 🚨 Instant Alerts: Automatically generates visual and audio alerts if crowd levels exceed defined safety thresholds.
- 📊 Analytics & Heatmaps: Offers crowd trend graphs and heatmaps (live, cumulative, and average) for deep analysis.
- 💾 Data Logging & Export: Saves crowd data with timestamps, exportable as CSV for further reporting.

✅ Suitable for use in:
- 🎪 Large Events & Public Gatherings: Festivals, concerts, rallies, exhibitions.
- 🏫 School & Campus Safety: Monitor canteens, hallways, or assembly areas.
- 🚆 Transportation Hubs: Metro stations, airports, bus terminals.
- 🏬 Commercial Spaces: Shopping malls, markets, or stadiums.
- 🚨 Emergency Evacuation Planning: Monitor crowd buildup during drills or emergencies.

## 🌟 Key Features  
- ✅ Real-time webcam or video input  
- ✅ YOLOv8-powered people detection  
- ✅ Grid-based zone tracking (3x3 matrix)  
- ✅ Visual alerts for overcrowded zones  
- ✅ Sound alerts (on supported systems)  
- ✅ Zone-specific crowd alert logs (Latest logs show on top)  
- ✅ Real-time metrics: Current, Peak, Average Density, Uptime  
- ✅ Trend Graphs (crowd over time)  
- ✅ Heatmaps: Last Frame, Cumulative, and Average  
- ✅ CSV Export of Detection Logs

## 🔔 Audio & Webcam Compatibility Notes
- 🔊 The app uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) powered by pyttsx3 for zone-specific crowd alerts. This feature works only on local systems (such as Windows).
- 💻 On cloud platforms like Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces, webcam access and audio alerts are not supported due to browser and platform restrictions. However, a video upload option is provided as an alternative, and a webcam option is also available—if it works in your browser, you can use it.
- ✅ To experience the app with full functionality (including real-time webcam access and voice alerts), it is recommended to run the app locally.

## 📊 Functional Overview
- 🎥 Detects people from webcam or uploaded video.
- 🧠 Uses YOLOv8 for real-time person detection.
- 🏙️ Divides the frame into 9 zones (3x3 grid) and counts people per zone.
- 🚨 Auto-alerts (visual + audio) when crowd exceeds the defined threshold.
- 📈 Trend graphs and heatmaps help analyze crowd patterns over time.
- 📝 Logs per-zone counts with timestamps into CSV for analysis.
